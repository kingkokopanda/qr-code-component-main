## Overview
I worked on creating a frontendmentor provided QR-code for both mobile and PC devices using HTML and CSS. Prior to this project, I submitted my first ever project (recipie page) using HTML and CSS through VS code. I, however,, still found challenges in this exercise. Please feel free to let me know in the comments on anything I may have missed or suggestions on what I could add, or substitute from my code. Thank you!

## My process
I first started with my index.html coding. with this project, I focused on one section at a time instead of going back and fourth between my index, and my main.css files. This actually helped me in not only time, but also clear minded in what it was I was trying to do for both my style, and my setup.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


### What I learned

As I am new to the front-end dev scene, I feel as if I am forever learning new things. For this project, I learned about the different ways you can implament colors into your code. While some people use RGB Colors (as I did in my Recipie page project) I decided to switch it up and use Hexadecimal Colors in this project. As I am still not sure on the different impacts on a project, I am keen on learning about the various types of color scemes in efforts to creating some dynamic and visually appealing designs in the future.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
h2{
    text-align: center;
    padding: 0 1.3rem;
    color: #1f3251;
}


p{
    font-size: 15px;
    text-align: center;
    color: #7b879d;
    padding: 1rem 3rem;
}
```
